<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Synthetics</li><li>Animal Extracts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Insulin Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) market is primarily categorized into two types: chemical synthetics and animal extracts. </p><p>Chemical synthetic insulin is produced through recombinant DNA technology, which allows for precise formulations and higher purity levels. In contrast, animal extracts derive insulin from animal pancreas, traditionally porcine or bovine sources, providing a more historical method of insulin production. While synthetic insulin dominates due to its efficiency and purity, animal extracts remain a niche option for specific patient needs or preferences.</p></p>
