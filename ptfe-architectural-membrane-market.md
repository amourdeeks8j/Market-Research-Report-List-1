<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTFE Architectural Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic PTFE Membrane</li><li>Hydrophilic PTFE Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PTFE architectural membrane market is characterized by two primary types: hydrophobic and hydrophilic PTFE membranes. Hydrophobic PTFE membranes repel water and are ideal for applications where water resistance and durability are essential, such as in roofing and façades. Conversely, hydrophilic PTFE membranes absorb moisture, promoting breathability and ventilation, making them suitable for applications in environments requiring moisture management, like in air filtration. Both types offer distinct advantages tailored to specific architectural and functional needs.</p></p>
